The Edge PC repository is a collection of various sample code for Node-RED for Edge PC:

1185416 â€“ EPC 1502 

1185423 -  EPC 1522 

Each example explains one or more topics on how to use Nodes and Function in the pre-installed Node-RED.

## Getting Started

1. Download this repository
2. Remove the .git folder
3. Adapt the files to your project
    *  Replace the README.md with your own, the [README_template.md](README_template.md) provides a template for all necessary content.
    *  Modify the [LICENSE](LICENSE). The recommended license is MIT.
    *  Name at least two maintainers in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).
    *  Tell developers whether its possible to contribute to your project and how to do it in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
    *  Check the [CodeOfConduct.md](CodeOfConduct.md) for updates.
    *  The [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) is nessessary in every project, but there is no need to modify it.
4. Initialize a new local repository or add the changes to your project repository

Ask via [mail](mailto:OSSPLCnext@phoenixcontact.com) for an organisation repository and you will get further information.
If your project meets all criteria and is validated to be an organizational repository, you are responsible for maintenance. 
If the project is outdated, we reserve the right to remove it.

## Import Example-flows into Node-RED of your EPC 1502/1522
1. <p> Connect to your Edge-PC via Ethernet and open the Edge-Cockpit. <br>
    Default: http://192.168.2.10/cockpit </p>
2. <p> Open Node-RED </p>
3. <p> Click on the "Import" button on the right upper corner. <br>
    ![Import_Flow](C:/Users/IMY5TB/Pictures/epc/Github/Import_Node.jpg "Import Flow") </p>
4. <p> Click on "select a file to import" and open up the example-flow you downloaded before. <br>
